content bubbles.
there is no escaping it. and while vendors are trying to figure out the best way to lock us in even more into the content production, the question is whether we can create a new serendipity online experience.
imagine walking through a bookstore and randomly stumbling on the book. the algorithms are chaining us into the pre-existing world, which is kind of sad. 


we are constantly told what to do, what to read, what to listen to. algorythms tailor the specialized content. 
this project was done to break away from the algorythmic tailored personalization and instead relized purely on randomness to throw the dice on what to read, listen to and where to go. 

initially we thought to give the user one option per category, but then we decided to randomly optimize the number of options available. hence, this is where the project is - it also randomly assignes a priority of the category and randomly assigns how many options to give you.

Viva la randomness
