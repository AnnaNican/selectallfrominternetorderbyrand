Impede her energies by the pains and penalties of law, and, like the Fame of <a href=""/wiki/Virgil"" title=""Virgil"">Virgil</a>, she will creep along the ground, diminutive in stature, and shrunk with apprehension: give free scope to all her tendencies, and she will soon collect her might, dilate herself to the fullness of her dimensions, and reach the stars.\\\\n']",['https://en.wikiquote.org/w/index.php?title=Gilbert_Wakefield&amp;oldid=2210870']

It\\\\u2019s something you can get your teeth into, and I find the psychology fascinating.
